# **Clover_LV_SensorHub_STM32F334R8T6**

Sensor Hub MCU, STM32F334R, of Clover.

With a new circuit design, this project has been built from the ground.

A couple of these MCU embedded circuits are attached on Clover, one on the front and the other on the rear and serve as follows.

1. **Read hall effect Wheel Speed Sensor(‚ÄùWSS‚Äù)** 
- Process PWM pulse generated from two WSSs in form of RPM(Revolution Per Minute.).
- Check for the duty ratio of each wheel if they are out of a predetermined range, implying the measurement is executed abnormally.
- Send two pairs, one pair for the left wheel and the other for the right, of a measured RPM value and its range check result to Infineon TriCore275 VCU through a CAN2.0B bus.
1. **Read Shock Absorber Contraction.**
- Process voltage signal - analog signal ranging from 0 to 5V - through ADC.
- 2 linear potentiometers per wheel, summing to 4 per circuit.
- Send those 4 values to an Infineon Tricore275 Datalogger through a CAN2.0B bus.
- Conversion from the saturation of the linear potentiometers to the actual movement of wheels shall be processed externally during post-race analysis.
1. **I2C Expansion Ready.**
- Though we do not have any I2C peripherals in Clover yet, the circuit has port enabled for an I2C device.
